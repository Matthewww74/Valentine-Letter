                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I know we won’t be able to spend the day together, and I honestly hate that, because every special day—even the ordinary ones, are meant to be spent with you. But even if I can't physically be there with you, I want to make sure you feel how much I love you, how much I adore you, and how much I wish I could hold you right now by making all of this for you.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I fr don’t even know where to begin because there’s so much I want to say. There’s so much love in my heart for you that I feel like no words will ever be enough. But I’ll ofc try.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I want to start by saying how grateful I am for yesterday. Our amusement park date wasn’t just fun, it was also unforgettable. It was my first time experiencing those kinds of rides, and honestly, if it weren’t for you, I probably wouldn’t have had the courage to try them like just being fr. But with you? I was willing to do anything. Every scream, every thrill, every laugh, every time I held onto you, it made me feel so alive (nawalan ng malay). Okay continue, uhm and it wasn’t just because of the rides, but because I was with you. Every single moment we spent there, I felt like the happiest person in the world. And I know it’s just one of the many, many memories we’ll be making together.
                    </span> 
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Sarah, I love you. I love you in ways that words can’t fully express. I love everything about you. The way you look at me, the way you speak, the way you laugh, the way you get shy when I compliment you, the way you overthink sometimes and then apologize for it even though you don’t have to because I’ll always be here to reassure you. I love the way you care, the way you love, the way you make me feel like I’m the luckiest person in the world. Because I am.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I want you in every version of my life, in my past, present, and future. If I could go to the future, I’d want to see the life we’re going to build together—the home we’ll share, the mornings I’ll wake up next to you, the nights I’ll fall asleep with you in my arms. Because that’s where I belong. With you. Forever.
                    </span> 
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  There will never be anyone else, my love. Not now, not ever. No one can ever replace you in my heart, because my heart is yours. You’re not just my love—you’re my person, my home, my future. I know we’re still young, but if there’s one thing I’m certain about, it’s you. One day, I will marry you. One day, we’ll have the life we always dreamed of, away from all the worries, the doubts, the pain. And until that day comes, I’ll keep proving to you just how much I love you, over and over again.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I miss you so much. I wish I could spend today holding your hand, kissing you, making sure you feel just how much you mean to me. But even if I can’t be there physically, I want you to remember that I’m always with you. In every thought, in every heartbeat, in every dream of the future I have. I’m always yours, and I always will be.
